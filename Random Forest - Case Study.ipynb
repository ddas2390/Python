    " You are a Data scientist at the Forest bank, and the bank has been facing a number of fraudulent transactions.  \n",
    "Fradulent transaction are those which are not done by the user itself but by a hacker or by a card thief or by doing a fishing attack. \n",
    "The bank has a huge dataset of it's credit card users and the bank has also done the job of marking these transactions as fraudulent or not. You being banks' Da    ta science expert have been given the task to first analyse this data and generate insights and then predict if a transaction on a credit card is going to be fraud or not.  \n",

    "Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA, this is a common process we follow when we first get the data. The idea is to analyse the data and to be able to generate insights create a lot of value in business problems.  Also this is the part where we decide on model building. We do a number of steps in this step, including but not limited to drawing graphs, pie charts and more.\n",
    "Basic Feature Engineering: We learn a new concept of 1 hot encoding here.\n",
    "Introducing Random forest: We start with understanding the basics of Decision trees, bagging, building our way to learn RandomForest.\n",
    "Decision Trees: We understand decision trees here, and their disadvantages.  \n",
    "Bagging: Learn a generic concept of bagging or bootstrap aggregating.\n",
